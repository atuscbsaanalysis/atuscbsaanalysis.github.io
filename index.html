    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>&emsp; It is well-known that people in the United States often live near extended family. Yet, far less is known about the heterogeneity of this proximity, especially in terms of variability between cities. Here, by studying the time spent with non-coresident family variable on the collection of activities recorded in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), together with the 'who' variable, we find evidence that the \textit{availability} of nearby non-coresident extended family across US cities varies widely. Concretely, the chances that an individual has a non-coresident family tie located in the same metro area, a feature we name observed fractional availability, decreases with population size of the metro. In contrast, the actual time spent in an activity with non-coresident family by those that perform it is generally non-decaying with population size. The Getis-Ord and Anselin's spatial indicators show that reduced observed fractional availability is predominant along US coastal areas and increases towards the center of the country. The consistency of observed fractional availability decay across most well-sampled activities captured by the ATUS allows us to postulate that the decaying trend with population size of observed fractional availability is a direct consequence of a decay in actual proximity of local non-coresident family. This demographic pattern of family distribution, not reported before, has important implications for a variety of social and economic effects such as wellness, mental health, and the provision of support for activities such as care for young children or the elderly. </p>
